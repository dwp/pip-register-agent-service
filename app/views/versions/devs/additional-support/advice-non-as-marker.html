        Please complete the form and send it back to us as soon as possible, to prevent delays to your claim. If you complete the form in full, your claim may be assessed without you needing an appointment with a health professional.

      If you have difficulties completing the form, you could either ask somebody to help you, or contact us on the number I gave you earlier.
